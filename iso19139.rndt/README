- Mandatory settings:
  In order to use correctly the RNDT plugin, a **configuration override** file must be applied at the GeoNetwork startup.
  In this way a proper metadata-tab configuration for the RNDT profile will be used and all fields will be presented 
  according to the RNDT specifications. The file to use for this is the 'config-override.xml' at the root path of the RNDT 
  schema-plugin.
  
  See the link below for more details on how the configuration override can be used into GeoNetwork:
  http://geonetwork-opensource.org/manuals/trunk/eng/users/admin/advanced-configuration/index.html#configuration-override


  You also need to add the iPA definition inside the ``config-gui.xml`` file.

  You need to add an ``RNDT`` element, defining all the PA organizations
  you want to handle inside you GN instance:

  e.g.:

```
<rndt>
    <ente>
        <name>Regione Piemonte</name>
        <ipa>r_piemon</ipa>
    </ente>
    <ente>
        <name>Regione Toscana</name>
        <ipa>r_toscan</ipa>
    </ente>
    <ente>
        <name>Ente di prova</name>
        <ipa>ente</ipa>
    </ente>
 </rndt>
```

- CSW: RNDT vs ISO
  In case you need to provide a further ISO endpoint, you have to create the 
  related service:
  
  <service name="csw-YOUR_ISO_NAME">
      <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher" >
          <param name="filter" value="YOUR_FILTER_HERE"/>
      </class>
      <output sheet="rndt2iso.xsl" />
  </service>
  
  The standard RNDT CSW output will transform gmx:MimeType into CharacterString, but many services expects 
  some file information in the MimeType attributes. So you need to edit the present/csw/iso-full.xsl file
  and comment out the template that performs this replacement; it's located toward the end of the XSL file
  and there are some comments about this use case.
  
  Now you need also to configure a further CSW endpoint for the RNDT output in this way:  
    
  <service name="csw-WHATEVER-rndt-WHATEVER">
      <class name=".services.main.CswDiscoveryDispatcher" >
          <param name="filter" value="YOUR_FILTER_IF_ANY"/>
      </class>
      <output sheet="rndt_fix.xsl" />
  </service>
   
  The rndt_fix.xsl transformations will apply the MimeType/CharacterString subst removed previously.
  You can find this file in the present/csw directory, but you'll have to copy in in the xsl/ dir 
  in order to let GeoNetwork find it.
